My project0 website:

The website consists of 4 html pages (Home, Career, Interests, Retirement). Each page has a title and a BootStrap NavBar that has hyperlinks to all the other pages. All pages use BootStrap's grid system rows/columns for layout. A couple of the pages that have .jpg images use @media formatting (in the .scss and .css files) to reduce the size of the images as the display window shrinks so that pictures don't overlap each other on smaller screens. The project also includes a sass file that generates my css file that is accessed by all 4 pages.

The project consists of the following files:

sean's_home_webpage.html
sean's_professional_career.html
sean's_interests_webpage.html
sean's_retirement.html
sean's_website.scss
sean's_website.css
sean's_website.css.map
index.html
README.md

There are also 2 directories  that contain additional source:

/video      ; Contains .mp4 source for video used on sean's_retirement.html page
/Images     ; Contains source for all .jpg images and a .pdf file of a trailmap.

Without making and exhaustive list of where all the project0 requirements are implemented, I'll just point out a couple. The unordered list is on the home page under interest. My table is on my Career page.  All the other formatting requirements are somewhat documented in my .scss and .css stylesheet files.
